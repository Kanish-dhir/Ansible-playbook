Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management,application deployment, and orchestration.

It follows a declarative approach, where you define the desired state of the system rather than scripting specific commands.

Ansible uses SSH for communication with target systems, making it agentless and easy to set up.


Inventory: The inventory file lists the target hosts on which Ansible will run
tasks. It can be a static file or generated dynamically.

Playbooks: Playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks and
configurations to be executed on target hosts.

Tasks: Tasks are the individual units of work in Ansible. They represent actions
to be performed on target hosts.

Modules: Ansible provides a wide range of modules for various tasks, such as
package installation, file manipulation, service management, etc.

Roles: Roles are reusable units of playbooks. They encapsulate related tasks,
handlers, variables, and files into a directory structure.

#Adhoc commands VS Modules

Ansible Adhoc commands vs modules
ad hoc commands:  are great for tasks you repeat rarely.
Ansible modules: are units of code that can control system resources or execute system commands

: -m is used for modules
:  ansible all -m ping -u ubuntu
